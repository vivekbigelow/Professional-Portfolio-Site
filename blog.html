        <h1>2/7/2024 - Switching to Next.js</h1>
        <p>
          I'm considering building the site with Next.js since it would allow me
          to create reusable React components across the site. So far I've been
          manually creating each page with HTML and CSS. I think the switch
          would also help me practice using React which is a plus.

        <h1>2/7/2024 - New Blog!</h1>
        <p>
          I started redesigning my portfolio site yesterday. When I first
          created the site I was mainly trying to make something fast in order
          to showcase different projects while applying to jobs. I always wanted
          to add a blog section as a way to document things I'm working on. I
          think I'll also highlight new topics I'm interested in as well. This
          blog will probably be all over the place since I'm pretty scatter
          brained.
